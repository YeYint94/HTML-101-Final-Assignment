                On January 23, 1971, Thant categorically announced that he would "under no circumstances" be available for a third term as secretary-general. 
                The 1971 United Nations Secretary-General selection was delayed by the anticipated arrival of the People's Republic of China, and the Security 
                Council did not begin voting until two weeks before the end of Thant's term. After every candidate was vetoed in the second round, Kurt Waldheim accidentally 
                won in the third round when the United States, United Kingdom, and China failed to coordinate their vetoes and all abstained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unlike his two predecessors, Thant retired after ten years on speaking terms with all the big powers. In 1961, when he was first appointed, the Soviet Union 
                tried to insist on a troika formula of three secretaries-general, one representing each Cold War bloc, to maintain equality in the United Nations between the superpowers. 
                By 1966, when Thant was reappointed, all the big powers, in a unanimous vote of the Security Council, affirmed the importance of the secretary-generalship and his good offices, 
                a clear tribute to Thant's work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In his farewell address to the United Nations General Assembly, Secretary-General Thant stated that he felt a "great sense of relief bordering on liberation" on relinquishing the 
                "burdens of office". In an editorial published around December 27, 1971, praising Thant, The New York Times stated that "the wise counsel of this dedicated man of peace will still be needed after his retirement". 
                The editorial was titled "The Liberation of U Thant".
            </p>
            <p>
                After his retirement, Thant was appointed a senior fellow of the Adlai Stevenson Institute of International Affairs. He spent the last years of his life writing and advocating the development of a true global 
                community and other general themes he had tried to promote while he was secretary-general. While serving as secretary-general, Thant lived in Riverdale, Bronx, on a 4.75-acre (1.92 ha) estate near 232nd Street, 
                between Palisade and Douglas Avenues.
