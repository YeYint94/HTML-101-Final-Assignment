                In September 1961, United Nations Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld was killed in a plane crash en route to Congo. 
                Within two weeks, the United States and the Soviet Union had agreed to appoint Thant as the Acting Secretary-General for the remainder of Hammarskjöld's term. 
                However, the two superpowers spent another four weeks arguing over the details of his appointment. On November 3, 1961, the Security Council recommended Thant in Resolution 168, 
                and the General Assembly voted unanimously to appoint Thant to a term of office ending on April 10, 1963.</p>
            <p>
                During his first term, he was widely credited for his role in defusing the Cuban Missile Crisis and for ending the civil war in the Congo. He also said that he wanted to ease 
                tensions between major powers while serving at the UN. His election to the position came about under unique circumstances, and his tenure marked a significant period in the history of the United Nations.

            <h3>Background and Election</h3>
            <p>
                U Thant's election as Secretary-General was unprecedented. He was serving as the UN's Acting Secretary-General following the sudden death of Dag Hammarskjöld in a plane crash in 1961. U Thant, then the Burmese representative to the UN, was appointed as Acting Secretary-General to ensure continuity during a critical time.
                In 1962, U Thant was formally elected as Secretary-General by the UN General Assembly. His election was notable as he was the first Asian and the first non-Westerner to hold the position.
